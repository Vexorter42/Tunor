"""Builds the tree the installer packs, out of a working copy of Tunor.

Nothing here is specific to one machine: paths come from the environment.

    TUNOR_APP     installed (or working) copy of Tunor, the source of the engine,
                  the helper scripts and the settings/rules used as a template.
                  Default: C:/Program Files/ssnet
    TUNOR_OUT     where the staged tree and the finished installer go.
                  Default: <repo>/build-out
    TUNOR_ENGINE  sing-box.exe to ship. Default: the one in TUNOR_APP/build.

What leaves this script is deliberately impersonal: keys, personal rule lists and
per-machine state are replaced or stripped below, because the result is published.
